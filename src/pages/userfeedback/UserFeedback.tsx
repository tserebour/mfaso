          <AccordionDetails>
            <Typography>To track infrastructure installation progress in the MFASO Smart Water & Sanitation system, you can use the platformâ€™s automated reporting tools. These tools provide real-time updates on project timelines, installation status, and any potential delays. You can also view progress reports that visualize the work through charts and graphs, giving you a clear overview of each phase of the infrastructure installation process.

Additionally, the system uses IoT sensors and GPS tracking to monitor the movement and installation of materials, allowing you to track the delivery and setup of products in real time. This ensures transparency and allows you to stay informed on the infrastructure developments in your area.</Typography>
